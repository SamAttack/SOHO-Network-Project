# SOHO Network Project (Cisco Packet Tracer)

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The goal was to design and configure a functional network that supports:
- Multiple end devices
- IP addressing
- Routing
- Basic security
- Internet connectivity

🧰 Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Network topology design
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Switch and router configuration
- Basic routing
- Connectivity testing (ping, simulation mode)

🗺️ Network Topology
See screenshots in the screenshots folder.

📂 Files
- `SOHO Network Setup.pkt` → Packet Tracer project file
- `screenshots/` → Network topology and test results

✅ Testing
Connectivity was verified using ICMP (ping) between devices and to the router.

📈 Future Improvements
- Add VLANs
- Add DHCP server
- Add firewall rules
- Add wireless access point
